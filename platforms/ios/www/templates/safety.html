    <h3>WARNING:</h3>
    <p>
        DO NOT SHOOT ANY AMMUNITION PRODUCING MORE THAN 600 FT LBS OF ENERGY. CHECK YOUR AMMUNITION SUPPLIER'S BALLISTIC SPECIFICATION SHEET TO DETERMINE THE ENERGY YOUR AMMUNITION IS RATED FOR. DO NOT USE ANYTHING OTHER THAN LEAD CORE BULLETS. DO NOT SHOOT BBs OR PELLETS AT THE TARGET. ALWAYS STAY A MINIMUM OF 10 YARDS IN FRONT OF TARGET.</p>

	       <p>This product is designed for .22LR caliber and up to .45 caliber round bullets. Do NOT use rifle rounds or any pistol round rated higher than 600 ft. lbs of energy at the yardage you’re shooting at as you may damage your target(s). Most all target loads for 9mm, .40 and .45 will fall within the safe limits of energy for your targets. You can shoot other pistols and rifles as long as you have chosen ammunition rated for your target. Use only lead core ammo. Stay a minimum of 10 yards away from the targets at all times. </p><br/><p>

            Always wear safety glasses and ear protection when shooting any caliber. Be sure that all spectators are also wearing appropriate safety gear. Polycarbonate glasses are recommended as they offer the best protection and are very lightweight.

        <div class="item item-text-wrap">
            <p>Small caliber bullets that impact your targets will generally deflect away in several smaller fragments, in an outward direction, perpendicular to its incoming path. See the ‘Front View’ in figure 1 below.  Bullets can and do ricochet but only when velocities, bullet material, and or target material are mismatched. For instance, steel core bullets hitting steel targets are very unpredictable. 100 yards is still not a safe distance for steel bullets. Thick but non-hardened steel plates can be dangerous if they develop a divot from a bullet impact as it leaves a concavity that when hit just right, can orbit the bullet inside the divot and send it directly back towards the shooter. Soft lead core bullets impacting hardened steel simply obliterates to dust and small fragments. </p><br/>
            <p>Copper jacketing or other metal jackets may bounce back towards the shooter and is the primary reason to wear safety glasses. </p>

            <p>
            Also note the side splatter deflection in the ‘Top View’ of figure 1. Side splatter adjacent to and 20 degrees in front of the target can be dangerous. The only safe place to be is in front of the target.  To contain debris from side splatter, be sure to have proper berms in place to absorb fragment impact. 
            </p><br/>
            <p>Always remain at minimum 10 yards directly in front of the targets at all times. If you can see any side other than the face, you are not in the safety zone. See figure 2 for the safe shooter zone. 
            </p><br/>
            <p><strong>NEVER SHOOT ANY SIDES OR THE BACK OF THE TARGET. YOU WILL DAMAGE IT AND POSSIBLY INJURE YOURSELF OR OTHERS.</strong></p><br/>

            <p>Try to minimize going down range for any reason. Autonomous Alloys' game modes are intended to start and stop without any person down range. If anyone goes down range, yell loudly “downrange” to others to let them know.</p><br/>

        </div>
        <div class="item item-text-wrap">
            <p>Your targets can be mounted on any 2x4 wood post or beam found at any hardware store. It can be mounted atop a post in a vertical fashion, or horizontally with the 2x4 fitting through the chassis. There is one optional bolt hole in the chassis to fasten the target to your  2x4 for extra rigidity if needed or desired. Always face the targets directly at the shooting station. Never shoot the target if you can see any side other than the face. The correct face of the target is shown here:</p><br/>
            <img src="img/safety-figure-3.png" style="max-width: 100%;border:1px solid #ccc;"/>
            <p>FIGURE 3</p>
            <br/><p>
            Targets can be mounted adjacent to one another, and above or below one another. The entire chassis is made of steel and will protect all internal components and any vertical or lateral debris.
            </p><br/><p>
            Be sure to mount all targets at shoulder height facing the shooters zone, and completely level. If your wood or mounts are uneven, use the bolt holes in the top of the chassis  to bolt the target level. A shooter should never see the electromagnet or the sidewalls of the chassis. If any part of the of the target other than the face and deflector are shot, it will be damaged. </p>

            <i class="ion-information-circled"> IV. POSITIONING YOUR TARGETS ON A RANGE  </i>
        </div>
        <div class="item item-text-wrap">
            <p>Position your targets such that a backstop exists for any missed shots. Also be aware that bullet fragments will deflect 360 degrees in all directions parallel to the target. As with all shooting targets, only use these over dirt as the bullet fragments will damage any other surface. DO NOT place the targets on concrete, asphalt, hard-packed clay, rocks, gravel, or other hard or rough surfaces that can cause fragments to ricochet back toward the shooter or others, or to ricochet in unpredictable directions. 
            </p><br/><p>
            Autonomous Alloys’ target’s has a paddle that can present a varying angle to a shooter when shooting fast or double tapping. This may cause fragments and even whole bullets to ricochet off the returning popper at a high angle, possibly overshooting a low backstop. As shown in figure 4 below, a popper at more than 30 degrees will likely fragment the bullet as it would in the upright position, however at less than 30 degrees, larger fragments or whole bullets may skim off. To avoid missing the backstop should this occur, make certain your target is placed close to the backstop such that any potential ricochet is contained.

            <p>The LED lighting of the MR-45 target is designed to use disposable replaceable LEDs. When a bullet strikes an LED, the internal shielding will direct the bullet and debris through a bullet chute and out the bottom of the target chassis. </p>

        <div class="item item-text-wrap">
            <p> Autonomous Alloys Targets include AR500 deflectors and paddles and are designed to handle up to .45 caliber bullets for thousands of rounds. If you detect any pits or damage in either of the components, stop shooting that target and contact Autonomous Alloys for replacement parts. 
            </p><br/><p>
            Deflector plates and poppers should only be replaced by Autonomous Alloys. Unlike target stands and uprights which can be repaired locally or at home, Damaged AR500 can not be repaired with standard welding or treatments. Do not attempt to repair or alter the paddle or deflector as it will lose all of its hardened/bullet resistant properties. Autonomous Alloys will always offer replacement parts for it’s products.
